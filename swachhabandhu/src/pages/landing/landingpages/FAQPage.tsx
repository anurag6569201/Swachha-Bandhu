    {
      question: 'How does the verification system work?',

      question: 'What types of issues can I report?',

      category: 'reporting'
    },
    {
      question: 'How do municipalities implement Swachh Bandhu?',
      answer: 'Municipalities go through a structured implementation process that includes initial consultation, platform customization, QR code deployment across the city, staff training, and a coordinated public launch. We provide ongoing support throughout this process.',
      category: 'municipalities'
    },
    {
      question: 'How can I become a CSR partner?',

    {
      question: 'What happens after I submit a report?',

      category: 'reporting'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is my personal information secure?',
      answer: 'Yes, we take data privacy very seriously. Your personal information is protected with enterprise-grade security measures. We only share the minimum necessary information with municipalities for issue resolution, and never share your personal details with third parties without consent.',
      category: 'general'
    },
    {
      question: 'How can I verify other users\' reports?',
      answer: 'When you are near a reported issue that needs verification, you\'ll receive a notification. You can then visit the location, check the issue, and confirm or flag the report based on what you observe. Each verification contributes to your points and community standing.',
