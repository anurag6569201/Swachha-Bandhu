# Swachh Bandhu - Civic Reporting & Gamification Platform



**Swachh Bandhu** (meaning "Clean Friend" in Hindi) is a modern, full-stack web application designed to empower citizens to report civic issues (like garbage dumping, broken infrastructure) and gamify their contributions to create cleaner, more accountable communities. It provides a powerful dashboard for municipal authorities to track, manage, and resolve these issues efficiently.

This platform bridges the gap between citizens and local governance through technology, transparency, and engagement.
